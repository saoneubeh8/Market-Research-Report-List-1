<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Springless Diaphragm Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-port Valves</li><li>3-port Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pneumatic springless diaphragm valves market comprises two main types: 2-port valves and 3-port valves. 2-port valves control the flow of fluid by opening and closing a single passage, making them ideal for on/off applications. In contrast, 3-port valves can either divert flow between two outlets or mix fluids from two inlets to a single outlet, offering greater versatility for complex systems. Both types leverage diaphragm technology for enhanced precision and reliability in fluid control applications.</p></p>

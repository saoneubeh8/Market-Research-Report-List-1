<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endotracheal Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cuffed</li><li>Uncuffeds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The endotracheal tube (ETT) market is primarily categorized into cuffed and uncuffed types. Cuffed tubes feature a balloon that can be inflated, creating a seal in the trachea, which is essential for patients needing mechanical ventilation, as it prevents air leaks and aspiration. Uncuffed tubes, on the other hand, lack this balloon and are often used in pediatric patients or for short-term airway management, providing less risk of airway obstruction but not suitable for prolonged ventilation.</p></p>
